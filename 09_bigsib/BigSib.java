HW09 -- What Are BigSibs Good For?
2021-10-04

DISCOVERIES
- Greet runs the greet function in BigSib

UNRESOLVED QUESTIONS
- I compiled both Greet.java and BigSib.java. Will Greet run without compliling BigSib?
- Does BigSib have to be in the same directory as Greet for Greet to run?

*/

public class BigSib{
	public static void main(String[] args){

	}

	public static void greet(String name) {
		System.out.println("Why, hello there, " + name + ". How do you do?");
	}
}
