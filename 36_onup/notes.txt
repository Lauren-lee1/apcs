HW36 -- All Quacked Up
2021-11-19
Time Spent: 

- first error message truely reliable, fix one error at a time
- debugg by bisection: make a copy of half the code
- delete half the time to see when an error comes up
- no base case causes infinite recursion
- use temporary variables, make code clearer and more concise
- explaining problem to someone (ducky!) might help you see the answer
